# CIS 680 - Software Development Project

This document describes the project that you and your group will develop throughout your time in CIS 680. The goal of this course is to provide you with an opportunity to experience a real-world software development project. You will plan, design, develop, test and deliver a software-based solution to a computing or business problem.

## Responsibilities

There will be several deadlines that will occur throughout the project. Some of these are outlined in the syllabus, and I have copied them here for your reference:

> * **February 9, 2024**: Submit your *final* project proposal for approval. 
>   * You should be submitting drafts of your project proposal **well before** this date for feedback! If you submit an unacceptable proposal on 2/9, **I will specify the requirements for your project** and it will be your responsibility to meet those requirements. It is therefore to your advantage to submit project plan drafts **early** so that we may discuss and negotiate your requirements!
> * **March 1, 2024**: Initial Project Checkin. More details in class.
> * **April 5, 2024**: Second Project Checkin. More details in class.
> * **May 3, 2024**: **Final Project submission due.** *No exceptions* without prior approval from instructor! Failure to submit a final project *will result in a grade of F for the course.*

It is your team's responsibility to ensure that your project is completed on time and that each step is submitted on its respective due date. **Failure to submit will result in ALL group members losing credit!** Only one group member is required to submit, however multiple group members may submit if you wish to ensure that your submission is turned in. 

In the event of multiple submissions from a group:

* If any submission is late while other submissions are on time, all late submissions will be completely disregarded.
* For on-time submissions, if more than one submission is received, the *later* submission will be graded. In other words, if one group member submits at 10 PM and another at 11 PM, I will grade the submission from 11 PM and disregard the 10 PM submission. This allows any of your group members to submit last-minute changes, but be careful - if you are going to have multiple group members submit the *same* submission, make sure everyone has the same file - if a later submission happens to be an "older version", that older version will be graded!
* Submissions from different group members will be treated equally. For example, if group member A makes three submissions all before the due date, the last submission from member A will be graded. However, if group member B makes three submissions and then group member A submits after those three but still within the deadline, I will grade the submission from member A.

## Specific Deliverables

### Project Proposal

You will start your project by writing a **proposal** and submitting it to me for approval. Your final project proposal must be **approved** by me no later than February 9, 2024. **If you have not submitted an approved project proposal by 2/4/2024 I will provide you with the specifics for your project and you will be required to follow them as written!** Therefore it is **strongly advised** that you submit drafts of your project proposal to me *early* for feedback. 

Your project proposal must include the following points:

* A brief overview of the system you will develop
* A description of the "user stories" - what is the workflow and logic flow of a session with your system; how will another user or application interface with your system; etc.
* Very rough outline of your timeline - when you expect to have various parts of your system operable
* Tools, frameworks and languages you will use to implement your system
* A list of the complete set of deliverables for your project. This list must include, but is not limited to:
  * The project proposal itself
  * UML diagrams or similar interface and interaction descriptions
  * Mockups for UI designs if applicable
  * Source code, database scripts, assets, etc. as needed to build and use the system
  * Documentation on how to build, test, and use the system
  * Deployment scripts (CI/CD) if applicable
  * Project management documents (SCRUM meeting notes, Gantt charts, etc.)

You may write your proposal in Microsoft Word, or you may use a language such as Markdown if you prefer. You may also submit a PDF version. **Keep your project proposal as it will also be part of your final submission.**

### Final Project Report

At the end of the semester, you will submit a final report for your project. You outlined the elements that will be included in this report in your project proposal. You will also include:

* A cover page, listing the title of your project, your group members' names, and the date of completion
* A copy of your project proposal
* A final writeup consisting of:
  * What was accomplished
  * Any struggles you identified as a group and any barriers you experienced to completing the project
  * Successes you experienced as a group
  * Any caveats or "things to know" for someone who might use your code in the future on another project or who might utilize your system
  * Instructions on accessing the source code. If you used a service such as Github, you can give me access to the code repository; or, you can submit code to D2L and indicate in your report that you have submitted code as required.
  * Copies of, or links to, documentation you produced during your program development

This report, along with your code and documentation, will constitute your final submission to the course and will also serve in place of your "final exam". 

## Group Expectations

**All group members are expected to fully and equally participate in the project!!**

Your group will select a team lead who will be responsible for overseeing the overall operations of the team, and can serve as your "first point of contact" within your team for questions or concerns. The team lead should act as the "SCRUM Master" during SCRUM meetings and should handle scheduling both meetings as well as work time for the group. The team lead is also responsible for ensuring that each task or component of the system is being delivered on time by the team members.

If you as a team lead are struggling with your group you may talk to me and I will intervene. However, I expect you to take initiative with your team and to recognize that **conflict is unavoidable** &ndash; it's *how you resolve the conflict* that makes you a great team member! If your group has reached a conflict that is unsolvable within your group, you may ask me to step in and meet with your group to help resolve the issue. 

As group lead your expected role in developing the project itself will be adjusted accordingly. In other words, the team lead will not be expected to write as much code or design as much of the system as other members may be expected to.

### Grading Your Individual Performance

One of your *individual* deliverables will be to both identify the specific tasks and role(s) you served in your group, as well as to **grade your other team members**. This will be your opportunity to identify if any members of your team were especially exemplary or were detrimental to your team's performance. I will take your assessments into account when issuing final grades - in other words, your final project grade is not simply "the same grade as the rest of the team" - a significant component will be your independent and individual contributions to the team and project. We will discuss this more further in the semester.
