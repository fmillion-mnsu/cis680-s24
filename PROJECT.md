# CIS 680 - Software Development Project

This document describes the project that you and your group will develop throughout your time in CIS 680. The goal of this course is to provide you with an opportunity to experience a real-world software development project. You will plan, design, develop, test and deliver a software-based solution to a computing or business problem.

## Overview

The Software Development Project is the most significant and important assignment for the entire course. The purpose of the project is to give you an opportnity to experience software development in a real-world context and in small teams. 

At the beginning of the course you will submit your resume. I will use the resumes you submit to assign you into small teams of 3-4 students. I will try my best to provide each team with individuals with a variety of skills as well as with skills that are most appropriate for the various projects.

## Projects

There are three options for deciding the project you will be doing For the course:

* You may choose from a list of projects that I will provide to you. These projects are university projects that involve software that has been or is being used by various departments within MSU. Projects are varied and involve skills including frontend, backend and full stack Web development, database development, analysis and design, and user interface design.
* You may present a self-directed project of your team's own choosing. If your team goes this route, you will write a proposal that outlines the project you will build and the specific deliverables (outside of course requirements) that you will produce. See below for details.
* If you choose neither, **I will assign you a project at random!**

## Responsibilities

There will be several deadlines that will occur throughout the project. Some of these are outlined in the syllabus, and I have copied them here for your reference:

> * **February 9, 2024**: Submit your *final* project proposal for approval. See above.
>   * You should be submitting drafts of your project proposal **well before** this date for feedback! It is to your advantage to submit project plan drafts **early** so that we may discuss and negotiate your requirements!
> * **March 1, 2024**: Initial Project Checkin. More details in class.
> * **April 5, 2024**: Second Project Checkin. More details in class.
> * **May 3, 2024**: **Final Project submission due.** *No exceptions* without prior approval from instructor. Failure to submit a final project *will result in a grade of F for the course.*

It is your team's responsibility to ensure that your project is completed on time and that each step is submitted on its respective due date. **Failure to submit will result in ALL group members losing credit!** Only one group member is required to submit, however multiple group members may submit if you wish to ensure that your submission is turned in. 

In the event of multiple submissions from a group:

* If any submission is late while other submissions are on time, all late submissions will be completely disregarded.
* For on-time submissions, if more than one submission is received, the *later* submission will be graded. In other words, if one group member submits at 10 PM and another at 11 PM, I will grade the submission from 11 PM and disregard the 10 PM submission. This allows any of your group members to submit last-minute changes, but be careful - if you are going to have multiple group members submit the *same* submission, make sure everyone has the same file - if a later submission happens to be an "older version", that older version will be graded!
* Submissions from different group members will be treated equally. For example, if group member A makes three submissions all before the due date, the last submission from member A will be graded. However, if group member B makes three submissions and then group member A submits after those three but still within the deadline, I will grade the submission from member A.

## Specific Deliverables

### Project Proposal

All teams will submit a **project proposal** 
If you choose to propose your own project, you must submit a project proposal that includes specific details about your project as outlined below. If you are working with an existing project, you will still submit a proposal but the deliverables and scope will be largely defined for you.

Your project proposal must include the following points:

* A name or title for your project
* A list of your team members with e-mail contact information
* A brief overview of the system you will develop
* A description of the "user stories" - what is the workflow and logic flow of a session with your system; how will another user or application interface with your system; etc.
* Very rough outline of your timeline - when you expect to have various parts of your system operable
* Tools, frameworks and languages you will use to implement your system
* A list of the complete set of deliverables for your project. This list must include, but is not limited to:
  * The project proposal itself
  * UML diagrams or similar interface and interaction descriptions
    * [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) is a useful free solution for generating UML diagrams from code.
  * Mockups for UI designs if applicable
  * Source code, database scripts, assets, etc. as needed to build and use the system
  * Documentation on how to build, test, and use the system
  * Deployment scripts (CI/CD) if applicable
  * Project management documents (SCRUM meeting notes, Gantt charts, etc.)

You may write your proposal in Microsoft Word, or you may use a language such as Markdown if you prefer. You may also submit a PDF version. **Keep your project proposal as it will also be part of your final submission.**

Your final project proposal is due by **February 9th at 11:59 PM**. You may however submit drafts to me for review as often as you like until that time. **If you are doing a self-directed project I STRONGLY suggest you send proposals EARLY so we can discuss any potential modifications you will need to make!!** If you submit an unacceptable proposal for a self-directed project, I will reject it and assign you an existing project and you will need to re-write your project proposal (with loss of credit for late submission).

### Project Check-ins

Twice during the semester you will provide a status update for your project.

You will 

### Final Project Report

At the end of the semester, you will submit a final report for your project. You outlined the elements that will be included in this report in your project proposal. You will also include:

* A cover page, listing the title of your project, your group members' names, and the date of completion
* A copy of your project proposal
* A final writeup consisting of:
  * What was accomplished
  * Any struggles you identified as a group and any barriers you experienced to completing the project
  * Successes you experienced as a group
  * Any caveats or "things to know" for someone who might use your code in the future on another project or who might utilize your system
  * Instructions on accessing the source code. If you used a service such as Github, you can give me access to the code repository; or, you can submit code to D2L and indicate in your report that you have submitted code as required.
  * Copies of, or links to, documentation you produced during your program development

This report, along with your code and documentation, will constitute your final submission to the course and will also serve in place of your "final exam". 

### Project Check-Ins

Twice during the semester - once on March 1st and again on April 5th - you will do a brief "check-in" on your project and present it to the class. You will prepare a short PowerPoint presentation (15-20 minutes) during which you will present the following:

* The current status of your project
* Challenges you have faced so far, and any plans you have for addressing them
* Successes you have had
* If possible a brief demo of your project in its current state
* Your plan for the next portion of the semester - before the next check-in, or how you will complete your project by the end of the semester

You will present as a group and these presentations will constitute a portion of your overall project grade.

Your presentation should not exceed 20 minutes - we would like to leave a bit of time for questions, both from instructor as well as your classmates. 

You will be graded on:

* your general, overall presentation design and delivery (hint: practice your presentation multiple times!)
* content of your presentation - are all required sections listed above included?

## Group Expectations

**All group members are expected to fully and equally participate in the project!!**

Your group will select a team lead who will be responsible for overseeing the overall operations of the team, and can serve as your "first point of contact" within your team for questions or concerns. The team lead should act as the "SCRUM Master" during SCRUM meetings and should handle scheduling both meetings as well as work time for the group. The team lead is also responsible for ensuring that each task or component of the system is being delivered on time by the team members.

If you as a team lead are struggling with your group you may talk to me and I will intervene. However, I expect you to take initiative with your team and to recognize that **conflict is unavoidable** &ndash; it's *how you resolve the conflict* that makes you a great team member! If your group has reached a conflict that is unsolvable within your group, you may ask me to step in and meet with your group to help resolve the issue. 

As group lead your expected role in developing the project itself will be adjusted accordingly. In other words, the team lead will not be expected to write as much code or design as much of the system as other members may be expected to.

While the total effort put in by each team member should be roughly equal, it is acceptable for team members to split up the work based on their strengths. For example, if you have a team member who is weak with coding but has strong documentation skills, it is acceptable for that team member to focus most of their efforts on documentation. I would like every team member to take part in all aspects of the project at least a small amount, but it is OK for you to prioritize certain tasks based on your skills. (This is part of what you can work out as a group during your sprint planning meetings - see below for details.)

### Grading Your Individual Performance

One of your *individual* deliverables will be to both identify the specific tasks and role(s) you served in your group, as well as to **grade your other team members**. This will be your opportunity to identify if any members of your team were especially exemplary or were detrimental to your team's performance. I will take your assessments into account when issuing final grades - in other words, your final project grade is not simply "the same grade as the rest of the team" - a significant component will be your independent and individual contributions to the team and project. We will discuss this more further in the semester.

## Project Management

You will use an Agile project management strategy for your project. We will cover the fundamental tenets of Agile in class. You do not need to use the entire Agile framework for a short course project, but you should be using the following fundamental Agile strategy points:

* You will have *weekly sprints*. A sprint is a single block of work, and the length of sprints varies between organizations and teams. For this class, one week sprints will give you a realistic experience. (It is not uncommon for longer or shorter sprints to be used in industry.)
* Each sprint will start with a *sprint planning meeting*. During the meeting, you will discuss and assign tasks amongst your team members. You can use time in class for your spring planing meeting. You also use this time as a *sprint retrospective* - a chance to look over the results of the last sprint, determine what went well and where challenges or failures occurred, and consider how to adapt your next and future sprints accordingly. 
* You should conduct regular *stand-up meetings* with your team. In many workplace teams this is typically done daily. You can arrange your own schedule and it does not strictly have to be every weekday, but you should be having at least one or two standup meetings *outside* of sprint planning meetings. 
  * The key point of a standup meeting is that it is meant to be *very brief*. 15 minutes is a common maximum hard time limit for standup meetings. (The term "standup" does not need to be taken literally, but the initial design of the meeting was to have all members standing up during the meeting to limit temptation to drag out the meeting.) 
  * Each team member should answer these three questions:
    * What have I done since the last stand-up?
    * What will I do before the next stand-up?
    * Are there any blockers that are preventing me from proceeding with my tasks?
* You should track your progress using some sort of project management software. There are freely available tools such as [Trello](https://trello.com) or [Atlassian Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) that are well suited for the task. 
* You *must* use some form of source code management solution. GitHub, BitBucket and so on are all acceptable. We will spend time in an early class session discussing the fundamentals of Git for those who may not be familiar with it yet. For your final submission, you may give me access to, and a link for, your source code repository.
