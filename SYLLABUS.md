## Course Description

> A clever person solves a problem - A wise person avoids it. *-Einstein*

This course is your chance to experience a real-world software development project. You will apply principles of object-oriented design, interoperability, and Agile project management. We will also discuss using unit and integration testing as well as concepts and principles of continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD). We will also review advanced programming concepts related to these topics, such as polymorphism, delegation and refactoring, as appropriate for your projects.

You will work in small teams on developing and implementing a software solution to a specific business or computing problem. I will provide you with several options for projects, but your group may also suggest a project with instructor approval. At the end of this course, you will have a solid foundation of knowledge and experience in not only the design and implementation of a software-based solution to a computing problem, but also an artifact that you can utilize in your portfolio in your future career endeavors.

## Prerequisites

This is a graduate level course for students in Computer Information Science department graduate programs. 

## Requirements

You will be participating in in-class activities that require a laptop to be brought to class. 

D2L will be used to provide you with course announcements, homework assignments, course materials and quizzes. Official course announcements will also be sent to you via your university E-mail address. You are responsible for regularly checking D2L and your university E-mail for communications.

## Group Project

This course will involve a capstone group project. You will work on in small groups of 3-4 students. The projects will include analyzing a problem, designing a solution, proposing your solution, and finally implementing your solution in software. 

Projects for this course will be business-related problems involving data and databases as well as user interface design. You will implement your solution in a programming language or languages selected by your group. **All project plans must receive instructor approval!**

## Important Dates

* **February 9, 2024**: Submit your *final* project proposal for approval. 
  * You should be submitting drafts of your project proposal **well before** this date for feedback! If you submit an unacceptable proposal on 2/9, **I will specify the requirements for your project** and it will be your responsibility to meet those requirements. It is therefore to your advantage to submit project plan drafts **early** so that we may discuss and negotiate your requirements!
* **March 1, 2024**: Initial Project Checkin. More details in class.
* **April 5, 2024**: Second Project Checkin. More details in class.
* **May 3, 2024**: **Final Project submission due.** *No exceptions* without prior approval from instructor! Failure to submit a final project *will result in a grade of F for the course.*

More details about the project can be found in the project description document.

## Grading

Your grade for the course will consist of:

Item | Percentage of Final Grade
---- | -------------------------
Final Project | 85%
Assignments | 10%
Attendance | 5%

There will be no final exam for this course. The work you do in your group assignments will be ongoing throughout the semester.

This course will use shaded grading. The following is the minimum score for each grade:

Percentage of Points | Grade
-------------------- | -----
97% | A+
94% | A
90% | A-
87% | B+
84% | B
80% | B-
77% | C+
74% | C
70% | C-
67% | D+
64% | D
60% | D-
0% | F

### Deadlines

Assignment due dates in this course are firm. Unless you have extenuating circumstances that you discuss with me *as early as possible*, assignments submitted late will lose significant points, up to an including a full loss of points for the assignment. 

With *rare* exceptions, assignments will be due on D2L or via an alternative submission mechanism at **11:59 PM** on the given due date. 

In general, I will use the following penalties for late assignments. Exceptions or modifications to these will be noted as appropriate.

Submitted | Maximum score
--------- | ----------
On Time | 100%
1 day late | 85%
2 days late | 75%
3 days late | 65%
4 days or more late | No credit

Late submission days *include weekends*. (If an assignment is due on Friday at 11:59 PM, submitting on Monday counts as 3 days late!)

### Attendance Grading

Because attendance is very important in small group project work, we will be taking attendance *randomly* in this course. On some days chosen randomly, you will take a very simple one-question quiz on D2L that will only be open for a very short time - this quiz will serve as your attendance record. On days when attendance is taken, I will announce the quiz question in class and you will submit your answer on D2L (the question will not be listed on D2L!).  Attendance grading will comprise 5% of your final course grade. 

If you need to miss a class for a university-sanctioned event or for a reason you feel should be considered an excused absence, **you must E-mail me at least 48 hours before class**. Except in rare circumstances (e.g. medical emergencies) I will not accept retroactive excused absence requests. If you are granted an excused absence for a class during which attendance is taken, you will receive attendance points for that day despite being absent.

### Grade Explanations and Appeals

You have the right to ask me for an explanation of any grade you receive, both on assignments as well as your final grade. 

Grade appeals are reviewed in instances where students perceive that a final course grade is unfair, arbitrary, or capricious. Students must begin the procedures of this policy within two weeks of university notification of a final course grade. Students needing assistance at any step in appealing a grade may contact the Academic Affairs Coordinator of the Student Senate (280 Centennial Student Union; phone 389-2611). Students should retain copies of all materials associated with this process for their records. Students should also have records of their coursework from the class as part of the appeal process. The full policy is available at <http://www.mnsu.edu/policies/approved/gradeappeals.pdf>.

## Diversity Statement

The diversity of the participants in this course is a valuable source of ideas, problem solving strategies, and computational creativity. Our classroom is a place where you will be treated with respect, and we welcome individuals of all ages, backgrounds, beliefs, ethnicities, genders, gender identities, gender expressions, national origins, religious affiliations, sexual orientations, ability, and other visible and nonvisible differences. All members of this class are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming and inclusive environment for every other member of the class. If you are experiencing disrespect or any other inappropriate conduct from any classmate, please talk to me directly. Unless university policy requires otherwise I will keep such conversations confidential.

### Name and Pronouns

I will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise me of this preference early in the term so that I may make appropriate changes to my records. I also expect other students to respect and honor these requests when interacting in the course. If you are experiencing any disrespect from classmates please come talk to me. I will keep any such discussions confidential.

## University Policies

### Academic Honesty

As members of the University community, students assume the responsibility to fulfill their academic obligations in a fair and honest manner. This responsibility includes avoiding inappropriate activities such as plagiarism, cheating, or collusion. Students found responsible for one or more of these activities may face both academic sanctions (such as lowering a grade, failing of a course, etc.) and disciplinary sanctions (such as probation, suspension, or expulsion).

In this course, I encourage you to ask your peers and utilize available online resources for assistance with projects and homework. However, such assistance must not include sharing or copying of code or solutions. All work you submit for your projects or assignments must be written by you or your group members alone. Here are some examples:

* Helping your classmate or another group understand why their syntax is causing a compilation error is OK; fixing it for them or providing a copy of your code to your classmate is not.
* Asking a classmate, group or online forum a question about why your code is not doing what you expect it to, and receiving answers guiding you to a solution that you implement yourself, is OK; asking someone to fix the code *for* you or simply provide you with working code that you will use as-is is not.
* Studying code online to learn how something is done and then implementing that solution in your own way is OK (as long as you understand and can explain your code); copying and pasting large amounts of code verbatim or with only very minimal changes is not. 
* **Artificial Intelligence Policy:** I treat code generated with artificial intelligence the same way I treat code obtained from a human-generated source (website post, book, classmate&hellip;). In other words, you *may* ask an AI system for assistance with your code and you *may* study code generated by the AI for ideas; however, you ***may not*** copy code provided by an AI engine verbatim or with only very minimal modification. As with any code you submit, you must fully understand and be able to defend your code. In situations where you may use the Internet but may not ask classmates, such as quizzes, you may use AI in a similar manner as you would online resources such as blogs or Stack Overflow, but you may not share your prompts or AI responses with other classmates.

> I exercise common sense in enforcing these policies. For example, if you discover that there is one single well-established strategy for accomplishing a given generic task and a template implementing that method is provided, and coding an alternative strategy would be excessively awkward or would create other secondary issues (e.g. insecure code, slower performance, etc.), then using such a template is not considered "copying and pasting large amounts of code verbatim". 
>
> To illustrate this, consider that many IDEs provide templates for various project types and also often offer "wizards" that generate parts of the code for you based on parameters you specify, with the generated code following established coding practices. Use of such tools is *not* violation of this policy, since they are generic in nature and you are still required to write the code to make the application perform your specific tasks.
> 
> However, asking an AI engine to write code for your *specific, unique* scenario, and then copying that code as-is, is a violation.
>
> If you have further questions on this policy, or want to ask about a specific scenario, please feel free to ask me. 

This course includes a group project. For the group project, specific requirements for submission of completed work will be outlined for that specific project. Each group will submit both a final group project deliverable *in addition to* individual submissions. For all work outside the group project, unless otherwise noted, you should assume *all* homework is to be completed and submitted **individually**.

The full policy, including definitions of plagiarism, cheating, and collusion, is available at <https://www.mnsu.edu/policies/approved/academichonesty.pdf>.

### Students with Disabilities

Minnesota State Mankato provides students with disabilities reasonable accommodation to participate in educational programs, activities or services, and I strive to make this course accessible and engaging for all learners, including students with disabilities. If you have a disability requiring accommodation to participate in class activities or meet course requirements, you should first register with the Office of Accessibility Resources (if you have not already) by following the process described at <https://mankato.mnsu.edu/university-life/campus-services/accessibility-resources/getting-started/> to establish an accommodation plan. Accessibility Resources will inform me about your needs in the course based on their records.

After this step, you can also choose to reach out to me and I will be happy to work with you directly to ensure all of your accommodations are provided to you and that you can participate fully in the course. Feel free to come to me or e-mail me any time if you are finding the course inaccessible in any way. I am happy to work directly with you to make any reasonable accommodation I can to ensure your success in this course. I will keep any information you share with me about your disability strictly confidential and will not disclose or discuss your disability with anyone else without your consent.

### Electronic Recording of Lectures and Materials

University policy states that students are not permitted to make unauthorized electronic recordings of lectures using personally owned recording devices (e.g., smartphone, iPad, computer, digital recorder) unless prior permission from the instructor is obtained, and there are no objections from other students.

Additionally, students are not permitted to make electronic copies of proprietary course materials (e.g., PowerPoints, formulas, lecture notes) without consent from the instructor. This does not apply to publicly available materials that are used in class.

If you need to record lectures or need course materials for an accessibility reason, please notify the Office of Accessibility Resources, and then discuss the matter with me as early as possible.

In any case where recording is permitted (even for accessibility purposes), recorded lectures or copied material must be destroyed at the end of the course or semester. Unauthorized downloading, file sharing, or distribution of any part of a recorded lecture or course materials, or using information from such recordings for purposes other than the student’s own learning, may be deemed a violation of Minnesota State University, Mankato’s “Statement of Student Responsibilities,” subject to disciplinary action.

The full policy is available at <http://www.mnsu.edu/atoz/policies/recordingoflecturesandmaterials2015.pdf>.

> The materials in this GitHub repository are licensed under CC-BY-SA and are publicly accessible on GitHub, and as such this policy does not apply to the materials in this repository. You may access, share and use these materials however you like provided you abide by the terms of the [CC-BY-SA 4.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en).

### Missed Classes

Students represent the university through participation in university sponsored or sanctioned activities, such as the arts, theater, music, dance, forensics, and intercollegiate athletics. If an activity schedule conflicts with academic obligations, students will follow a standard protocol to provide their faculty members with prior, written notification of their absences from classes. Faculty members will determine, in consultation with students, how missed classes and assignments will be made-up in a manner that fulfills academic obligations and accommodates participatory obligations. Except for absences resulting from sponsored or sanctioned activities, student participants have the same responsibility with regard to class attendance and assignments as do all other students.

The full policy is available at <http://www.mnsu.edu/atoz/policies/missedclassesandmakeupwork.pdf>.

If you need to miss class for an important non-school-related reason (e.g., a medical appointment), please let me know ahead of time, as early as possible. I understand that sometimes extenuating circumstances may arise suddenly without warning. In this case, please contact me by E-mail as soon as you possibly can to let me know you will be unable to attend class and/or meet a deadline. Within reason we will work together to come up with a solution. The more openly we communicate, the easier it is for me to accommodate your situation!

If you test positive for COVID-19 but are *not symptomatic*, please come to class and wear a mask to protect others. If you *are* symptomatic, please let me know via E-mail as soon as possible and we can arrange for you to attend the course via Zoom temporarily.

### Veterans Information

As a particular acknowledgment of an individual's service to our country, faculty members are committed to providing resources to veterans/military students, which will assist in smooth navigation of the university environment and a successful educational experience. Resources for veterans are available at <http://www.mnsu.edu/veterans/resources>. *Student veterans and current military members with special circumstances or who are activated are encouraged to notify the instructor.*
